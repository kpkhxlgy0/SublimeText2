Supported platforms
-------------------

This plugin has been tested on Linux platform and should work the same on OS/X or Windows platforms. It has NOT been tested ont those last two.

If you encounter some problem with OS/X or Windows, register an issue or submit a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/srilumpa/SyntaxChecker).

Installation
------------
**With the Package Control plugin:** The easiest way to install SyntaxChecker is through Package Control, which can be found at this site: http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control

Once you install Package Control, restart ST2 and bring up the Command Palette (`Command+Shift+P` on OS X, `Control+Shift+P` on Linux/Windows). Select "Package Control: Install Package", wait while Package Control fetches the latest package list, then select SyntaxChecker when the list appears. The advantage of using this method is that Package Control will automatically keep SyntaxChecker up to date with the latest version.

**Without Git:** Download the latest source from [GitHub](https://github.com/srilumpa/SyntaxChecker) and copy the SyntaxChecker folder to your Sublime Text 2 "Packages" directory.

**With Git:** Clone the repository in your Sublime Text 2 "Packages" directory:

    git clone git://github.com/srilumpa/SyntaxChecker.git


The "Packages" directory is located at:

* OS X:

        ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/

* Linux:

        ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/

* Windows:

        %APPDATA%/Sublime Text 2/Packages/
